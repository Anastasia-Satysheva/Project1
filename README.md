## Welcome to Hikes & Hops app Website!

This is Anastasia and Emily and Travis first group project in which we plan to showcase our ability to utilize APIs and build a simple obile friendly app.
This app allows you to find a hike, as well as nearby restaurants. The concept is that that you can burn calories first, then follow up with replacing those calories with delicious food! Quite exciting, isn't it?

### Features

It's a simple application that allows the user to look for trails near him or it's possible to search by state/city. Also the user is able to check the weather for the trail and its possible to find restaurats close by. Each trail and restaurant result has a link to its own website so the user can look more information up. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
